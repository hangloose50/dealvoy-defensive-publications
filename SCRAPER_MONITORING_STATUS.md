### Alert Criteria
- Red banner: Any scraper with `fail_count > 3` in 72h
- Tooltip: Shows last error, last pass, contact
- Pie chart: QA pass/fail ratio

### Known Edge Cases
- If `scraper_status_log.json` is missing or malformed, dashboard shows empty state
- If Chart.js fails to load, analytics chart is hidden
- Tooltips require mouse hover (not mobile-friendly)
- File URLs may require browser security override for local preview

### Next Steps
- Integrate with backend for real-time updates
- Add per-source execution time analytics
- Expand alert logic for rate-limited/blocked
- Add mobile responsive styles
